S000028862	telomere		TEL01L			chromosome 1		1	801	1	C	-64	2003-09-09	2003-09-09	Telomeric region on the left arm of Chromosome I; composed of an X element core sequence, X element combinatorial repeats, and a short terminal stretch of telomeric repeats
000029657	not in systematic sequence of S288C		MAL23	MAL23	MALR		L000001013								MAL-activator protein; encoded within the complex locus MAL2; required for maltose and isomaltose utilization
S000029684	not in systematic sequence of S288C		MAL34	MAL34			L000001017								ORF with sequence and positional similarity to the MAL64 gene; the MAL64 gene is thought to be a nonfunctional copy of MAL63; encoded within the complex locus MAL3 in some strains of S. cerevisiae, but not in S288C
S000149345	not in systematic sequence of S288C		IMI1	IMI1											Protein involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and glutathione homeostasis; localized to the cytoplasm; in W303 strain IMI1 is encoded by one continuous open reading frame comprising of YDL037C, the intergenic region and YDL039C, while in the reference sequence of S288C, YDL037C encodes Bsc1p and YDL039C encodes Prm7p.
S000150108	not in systematic sequence of S288C		MPR2	MPR2											L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid acetyltransferase; reduces intracellular ROS, contributes to L-proline analog resistance and tolerance to ethanol and freezing; member of N-acetyltransferase superfamily; not found in S288C, present in strains with Sigma1278b background; located on left arm of Chr X ~ 15 kb from telomere; identical to MPR1 except for one base at position 254, leading to Gly at position 85 in MPR1 and Glu in MPR2; present also in Japanese industrial baker's yeast
