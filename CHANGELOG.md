# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (2017/11/15)

This is our very first release. It has bot been tagged as `1.0.0` as it should
have, but it took time to have a fully functional deployment strategy.

Features:

* Data modeling
* CircleCI integration
* Sass-based UI
* Fully dockerized stack
* Registered users authentication
* Importation workflow UI
